#A Coding Challenge for a Job interview
The goal was to create a search enginge for Beer using the punk API.
The User should be able to query the API with some sort of user interface, and the results should be returned in a list.
Selecting a beer from the list should return a page with more detail about the beer.

The approximate Time given was 6-7 Hours.

## Personal Note
I focused on functionality rather than styling, using routes, nested components, and image displays, attempting 
to emulate the way I would otherwise build a website.

Given the same Task a second time I would probably cut some of the demanded features and focus on making the delivered features
look more visually pleasing using flex boxes, and a styling library as well as premade react components.

## Tools

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses typesript as far as possible.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
